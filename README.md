Wilderness is a light wrapper around [argparse][argparse] for creating command 
line applications with multiple subcommands, in the style of [Git][git]. 
Wilderness also makes it easy to generate man pages for your application.

Wilderness is heavily inspired by [Cleo][cleo] and 
[argparse-manpage][argparse-manpage], but aims to stick as closely as possible 
to [argparse][argparse] to avoid users having to learn a new API.

## Installation

Wilderness is available on PyPI:

```
$ pip install wilderness
```

## Usage

Building command line applications with Wilderness is straightforward, but it 
does expect a certain structure of the application. You can create 
applications with or without subcommands, as illustrated with the 
[fakegit][fakegit] and [fakedf][fakedf] examples, respectively.

Creating wilderness applications consist of the following steps:

1. Subclassing the ``wilderness.Application`` class to hold the main 
   application.

2. Adding one or more ``wilderness.Command`` objects for each of the 
   subcommands, optionally organized into ``wilderness.Group``s.

3. Minor changes to ``setup.py`` to build the manpages.

## Examples

Here are some examples that use Wilderness to build command line applications:

| Repository | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [fakegit][fakegit] | A multi-level command line application similar to Git |
| [fakedf][fakedf] | An application without subcommands similar to df |
