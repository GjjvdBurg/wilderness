# Wilderness

Wilderness is a light wrapper around [argparse][argparse] that makes it easier 
to build command line applications with multiple subcommands, such as 
[Git][git]. Wilderness also makes it easy to generate man pages for your 
application.

Wilderness is heavily inspired by [Cleo][cleo] and 
[argparse-manpage][argparse-manpage], but aims to stick as closely as possible 
to [argparse][argparse], to avoid users needing to learn a new API.
